### Slog: Data-Parallel Deductive Programming

![CI](https://github.com/harp-lab/slog-lang/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

Slog is a language, compiler, and runtime system for implementing
data-parallel deductive programming.

## Components

- `compiler/`         -- Compiler from Slog source code to a parallel RA plan
- `backend/`          -- MPI-based parallel relational algebra plan (RA) runtime
- `slog/`             -- Python code for interacting with Slog:
- `slog/protobufs/`   -- Wire-level protocol
- `slog/daemon/`      -- Server for managing, queuing, and storing Slog jobs
- `slog/repl/`        -- Interactive CLI for Slog

## Building and Executing

![cli](./cli.gif)

## Using Docker

First, build the Docker image and start up the server:

```sh
docker build --tag slog .
docker run --name=slog --entrypoint=/slog/slog-server --rm --detach slog
```

You may want to run with `--network=host` to expose all the Slog ports to your
host.

### Using the REPL from inside the container

In a separate terminal:
```sh
docker exec --interactive --tty slog bash
./slog-repl
```

### Running scripts from outside the container

First, install the Python dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then:

```sh
./runslog 127.0.0.1 tests/tc.slog
```

If you ran without `--network=host`, you can find the container's IP like so:

```sh
docker container inspect slog --format '{{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}}'
```

## Another way to setup slog

Open Terminal -> Download slog repo using the git repo (https://github.com/harp-lab/slog.git)

Using Docker desktop application:

         1.    Install Docker desktop application using https://docs.docker.com/desktop/
         
         2.    Place the downloaded file in Applications folder(if on mac). Double-click on the the downloaded .dmg file to get started.
         
         3.    Go to Terminal -> cd to slog directory
         
         # Create docker image

         docker build -t slog-daemon .

         docker run -d --name slog-server slog-daemon
         
         # keep two terminals open and change the current directory to the directory where slog is installed.

         One terminal to run the slog-server and another to run the slog-repl
          
         # To Up the slog-server

         docker exec -it slog-server bash

         ./slog-server
         
         # To go onto the REPL

         docker exec -it slog-server bash

         ./slog-repl

         4.   Work on the programs / slog-repl as required

  ## Common issues on setup & how to solve
  - Windows
	  - <strong>WSL</strong>:
		  - Docker has issues running on WSL if you are using a Linux Distribution running on WSL 1. To check your distribution version run
		  - ``wsl -l -v``
		  - If your main distribution (denoted by the asterisk) is version 1, upgrade it using 
		  - ``wsl --set-version <distro name> 2``
		  - Restart your terminal and try Docker again


## CSPA test
CSPA test program is located under `analysis/cspa.slog`
1. dowload dataset from google drive to root dir of slog. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1meoqulLRXMqLsb9S66NqUqP5mFUuDpzv/view?usp=sharing
2. unzip it
```
unzip ./linux.zip
```
3. build docker image and enter test container
```
docker build -t slog .
docker run -it --rm --shm-size=32g slog bash
```
4. run test program
```
./runslog -v -R -j 8 -f ./linux ./analysis/cspa.slog out
```
5. in the generated REPL, use `relations` command to check size of computed relations
